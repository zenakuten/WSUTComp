- Add whitelist feature.  

New config values:
   bUseWhitelist=False
   bEnableWhitelist=False
   WhitelistBanMessage=Not allowed.  Contact the server administrator to gain access

If 'bEnableWhitelist' is true, white list GUI is enabled.  Admins will see a new Admin button in UTComp F5 menu.  Admins can turn on/off the whitelist.  Default is false.

If 'bUseWhitelist' is true, white list is enabled.  Only players with matching PlayerIDs are allowed into the game.  Default is false.

Banned players will see an auto kicked message when they try to join the server.  Change WhitelistBanMessage accordingly.  

The white list is an ini file called 'UTComp_Whitelist.ini' in the System folder.  

[UTCompOmni.UTComp_Whitelist]
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID1
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID2
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID3
etc...

To use SetPreferredExit, you'll need to bind a key to it and combine with the use command, e.g.

in User.ini - 
Q=SetPreferredExit Left 1 | Use
E=SetPreferredExit Right 1 | Use

This would make 'E' exit to the right and 'Q' exit to the left.

Vehicle radar colors can be configured in UTCompOmni.ini file

Here are the defaults:

[UTCompOmni.UTComp_ONSHudOnslaught]
VehicleData=(Name="Minotaur",RadarColor=(B=255,G=255,R=255,A=255))

- Make minotaur, omnitaur and badgertaur minimap color white so they stand out
